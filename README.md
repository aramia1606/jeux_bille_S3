## 🎮 Game Overview

- 🧠 **Turn-based logic**: Players take turns moving stones based on classic Mancala rules.
- 🔁 **Game loop** manages state transitions, captures, and score updates.
- 💡 **LED indicators** and screen output display the current board state and turns.
- ⌨️ **Buttons or switches** used as player input.
